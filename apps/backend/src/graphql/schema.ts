// The schema lives in ./schema/*.graphql, one file per domain, next to the
// resolvers that implement it in ./modules. Keeping it in real .graphql files
// (rather than template literals) means editors syntax-highlight it and GitHub
// counts the project as using GraphQL.
//
// base must come first: the domain files `extend` the root types it declares.
