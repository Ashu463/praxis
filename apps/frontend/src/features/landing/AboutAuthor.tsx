            I&rsquo;ve used tools like Lovable to ship things fast, and the part
            that actually pulled me in wasn&rsquo;t the chat UI — it was
            wondering what has to be true underneath for a prompt to become a
            running, previewable app. An orchestrator deciding when to ask
            clarifying questions versus just building, a planner turning a
            request into a dependency graph of tasks, sub-agents that write
            and test code in a loop, and a way to stream all of that back to a
            browser in real time. That&rsquo;s a real distributed system, not
            a wrapper around an LLM call.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I built one, end to end: a Bun/Turborepo monorepo with an
            orchestrator + sub-agent package, a Postgres/Redis-backed
            backend, and this frontend — to understand every layer well
            enough to defend it in a room, not just demo it. Along the way I
            found and fixed a real bug in my own event pipeline (a few status
            transitions were computed but never actually emitted over SSE) —
            the kind of thing you only find by building the whole thing
            yourself.

            this are written up in detail, including what I&rsquo;d change
            with more time — and the{" "}

            even deeper for anyone who wants the whole story.
